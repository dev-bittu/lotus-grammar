here are some rules you have to follow:
- in func defination you have to put curly bracket with definition like golang nor like c++.
example:
```lotus
fn main() {  // allowed
    println("Hello World!")
}

fn main()
{  // not allowed
    println("Hello World!")
}
```
- in lotus enum is enum you cant compare it with integers altough enum is made up of unsigned integers
